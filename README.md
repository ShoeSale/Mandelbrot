# MANDELBROT SET GENERATOR APP
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Welcome to my glorious library
this is a simple app that based on the input parameters
(resolution, center point and width) you can generate
a colorful picture of the mandelbrot set that saves all on its own
### steps to get this to work (hopefully)
get this virtual environment running with
`source venv/bin/activate`
hopefully that gets you on python 3.10.8 (3.10.7 should also work)
intall Pillow
then run the thing
`python mandelbrot_gen_app.py`
hopefully that gets you there.
